- Added new solar calculation method "Bras"
	- New Cumulus.ini entries...
		SolarCalc=0    		(0=Ryan-Stolzenbach, 1=Bras, default=0)
		BrasTurbidity=2   	(atmospheric turbidity factor (2=clear, 5=smoggy, default=2)
	- Updated the Interface web files to reflect the new settings.

- Updated HidSharp to ver 2.0.5
	- Now uses libudev1 for Fine Offset and WMR200 stations

- Fixed corrupt/missing MySQL port causing CumulusMX to crash on startup

- Attempt to reconnect to Davis IP logger on connection failure (only a possible fix)

- Updated the default forum URL to it's new home

- Updated included website files to new URL

- URL encode Twitter messages (I know Twitter is largely broken)

- Davis VP2 - (Steve Loft) Added sanity checks for invalid wind speed/direction values

- Davis VP2 - Added automatic disabling of the use of LOOP2 packets on firmware versions < 1.90

- Change RG11 devices to use a new Cumulus.ini file entry. The previous MX builds would not work on Linux.
  For example:
	RG11port=2   (depreciated)
	RG11port2=3
		now use
	RG11portName=COM2   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB2 for Linux)
	RG11portName2=COM3   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB3 for Linux)

- The default Comm port values are now set to either COM1 or /dev/ttyUSB0 depending on the platform. Hopefully this will prevent some of the confusion of new users.
