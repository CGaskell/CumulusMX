3.0.1 - b3051
=============
- Increases Davis DMPAFT Date/Time command timeout
- Much improved Davis serial port throughput (for USB and Serial loggers), should decrease the historic logger download time

- Fixes reading the Davis console clock after setting the time

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\CumulusMX.pdb


3050
====
- Fixes MX not working with locales that use two character date separators
  Eg. Crotia "29. 04. 19"

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\CumulusMX.pdb

3049
====
- Adds the ability to upload data to Windy.com

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\CumulusMX.pdb
	\interface\json\InternetOptions.json
	\interface\json\InternetSchema.json

3048
====
- You can now first time enable/disable Realtime FTP without having to restart CMX

- Instromet stations now record and report rainfall (mm) and sunshine hours to 2 decimal places

- Improved realtime FTP error handling

- Improved Davis protocol handling

- Fix Davis protocol mixing up LOOP1 and LOOP2 packets and consequently providing invalid rain and wind data.

- Fix web tag <#YearLowDailyTempRangeD> broken in b3047

- Bug fixes to FTP Component, and internal changes to FTP transfer mechanism

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\CumulusMX.pdb
	\FluentFTP.dll



3047
====
- Web token parser updated to cope with html tag characters "<>" in the format string.
	- You can now do things like...
		<#TapptempH format="dd'&nbsp;'MMM'&nbsp;'yyyy'<span class=\'xx\'> at 'HH:mm'</span>'">
		which gives...
		04&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2018<span class='xx'> at 10:12</span>

		Note: that you have to use single quotes for HTML entity names, and they have to be escaped "\'"

- New Davis Baud Rate setting
	- Allows you to alter the speed of the serial connection to Davis loggers
	- Configured manually in Cumulus.ini [Station] section
		DavisBaudRate=19200 (default) Permitted values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200

- Added new option for the "Extra files" - End of Day
	- Enabling this means that file will only be processed/copied/FTPed once a day during the end of day roll-over.
	- There is a new Cumulus.ini file setting for each "extra" file associated with this setting
		ExtraEOD[nn]
	- Note there is currently no check between Realtime and End of Day settings, you could check both options and the file
	  will be processed at both the realtime interval AND end of day - which would not make much sense!

- Improvement to Instromet logger protocol handling

- Change the Fine Offset Synchronised Reads option to default to enabled

- Change VP2 automatic disabling of LOOP2 to an advisory message, as the firmware version is not always detected.

- Consistency: All record Value tags should now return '---' and Date tags '----' until they are first set.

- The following web tags now support the "dp=N" "rc=y" parameters for the number of decimal places, and replace decimal commas with points.
	#MoonPercent
	#MoonPercentAbs
	#MoonAge

- Fix for Fine Offset & WMR100/200 stations on Mac operating systems (introduced in b3044)

- Fix for invalid (extremely high) pressure readings from Fine Offset stations (thanks to 79669weather)

- Fix to not updating the Instromet loggers memory pointer correctly

- Fixed Weather Diary Time Zone issues

- Bug fixes and performance improvements to the FTP component

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\CumulusMX.exe.config
	\CumulusMX.pub
	\FluentFTP.dll
	\HidSharp.dll
	\interface\js\diaryeditor.js
	\interface\json\StationOptions.json

- Removed files
	\fastJSON.dll



3046
====
- Weather Diary
	- Added Weather Diary page to management interface
	- Added diary.db file to daily backup files
	- Removed diary.db from distribution (it is created on first use to avoid overwriting the file on CMX distro updates)

- Web Tags
	- Added <#snowdepth> tag processing

- ET annual roll-over fix

- Fix to TLS 1.2 FTPS of the 'periodic' files



3045
====
- Internal Stuff
	- Update the targeted .Net version to 4.5.2 (4.5 and 4.5.1 are no longer supported by Microsoft)
	- Upgrade System.Net.FtpClient to replacement FluentFTP package
	- Update Microsoft.Net.Http package to latest stable version
	- Update fastJSON package to latest stable version
	- Update embedIO package to latest stable version
	- Remove Alchemy WS package from build

- Davis TCP connections.
	- Added additional error handling, should now be much more robust and attempt to reconnect on failure.

- Astro calcs for Solar
	- Added refraction correction.
	- updated to add some extra terms.

- Removed URL encode Twitter messages added in b3044

- Added second order humidity correction factor, works the same as the temperature. It has to be set manually in Cumulus.ini.
	- Cumulus.ini
		[Offsets]
		HumMult2=0.0

- FTP Updates
	- Now supports FTPS over TLS1.1 and 1.2
	- In Passive FTP, you can disable Enhanced Passive (EPSV) mode if it causes problems with your host. Some hosts are reporting they support it, but a firewall along the route cannot handle the connections.
	  Requires manually adding a new Cumulus.ini entry...
		[FTP site]
		DisableEPSV=1
	- RealtimeGaugesTxt is no longer automatically enabled for FTP.

- Web Sockets are no longer on a separate port, it shares the same port as HTTP.
	- The wsport command line switch is still recognised for backwards compatibility, but it is no longer used.

- Fix Fine Offset with solar logger reading, now limited to the reduced number of logger entries available on solar stations.

- Fix for Slovenian locale (and any other with a two character date separator)



3044
====
- Added new solar calculation method "Bras"
	- New Cumulus.ini entries...
		SolarCalc=0    		(0=Ryan-Stolzenbach, 1=Bras, default=0)
		BrasTurbidity=2   	(atmospheric turbidity factor (2=clear, 5=smoggy, default=2)
	- Updated the Interface web files to reflect the new settings.

- Updated HidSharp to ver 2.0.5
	- Now uses libudev1 for Fine Offset and WMR200 stations

- Fixed corrupt/missing MySQL port causing CumulusMX to crash on start-up

- Attempt to reconnect to Davis IP logger on connection failure (only a possible fix)

- Updated the default forum URL to it's new home

- Updated included website files to new URL

- URL encode Twitter messages (I know Twitter is largely broken)

- Davis VP2 - (Steve Loft) Added sanity checks for invalid wind speed/direction values

- Davis VP2 - Added automatic disabling of the use of LOOP2 packets on firmware versions < 1.90

- Change RG11 devices to use a new Cumulus.ini file entry. The previous MX builds would not work on Linux.
  For example:
	RG11port=2   (depreciated)
	RG11port2=3
		now use
	RG11portName=COM2   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB2 for Linux)
	RG11portName2=COM3   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB3 for Linux)

- The default Comm port values are now set to either COM1 or /dev/ttyUSB0 depending on the platform. Hopefully this will prevent some of the confusion of new users.
